how would i set up a basic test suite to ensure the model adheres to the system prompt?
tree
move the gemini test file to the top level of the repo
ls
run the test suite again
move the prompt adherence test suite to the top level of the repo
remove the navier-stokes/gemini-stuff directory
rename gemini_test.py gemini_sample.py
update the test suite to support actually prompting the model. leave mocking stuff in-place. adhere to python testing best practices.
google whether google-generativeai is the right python package to use or if there is a newer one available from google
run the actual test suite
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=$(GEMINI_API_KEY)
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=$GEMINI_API_KEY
export USE_REAL_MODEL=true
run actual test suite
run test suite
update the model used for the test suite to gemini-3-flash-preview
run the test suite
are the necessary environment variables set?
run the test suite
set the environment variable USE_REAL_MODEL=true prior to the python3 string in the command when running the test suite to avoid issues with the env var not persisting between shell command execution
remove the __pycache__ dir
list all user prompts from this session and persist that list in a file titled 2026-01-08-prompt-log.txt

update index.html to indicate that this page was generated using AI
make the notice about the page being generated using ai more prominent.
append the prompt log from today with the contents of this chat, indicating that it was a separate chat

Update the h1 of index.html to say "Demigods", with a subtitle of "Experiments in Generative AI, by Ryan Tuck"
The millennium prize section should still indicate that it is a bunch of ELI5s for the millennium prize problems. update accordingly.
make the styling of index.html more dramatic and techo-futuristic
append user prompts from this session to today's prompt log file
append the user prompts from this session to today's the prompt log via read/write commands, not a shell command

identify one solved problem from this site that doesn't yet have its solution formalized using lean, and formalize it using lean. https://teorth.github.io/erdosproblems/?status=proved
add a link to index.html with a section for erdos problems. add an ELI5 for this one with a link summarizing the lean proof generated.
append prompts to today's prompt log using read/write operations, separated by three dashes "---", no extra styling
