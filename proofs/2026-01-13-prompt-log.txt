1. This is the Gemini CLI. We are setting up the context for our chat. Today's date is Tuesday, January 13, 2026 (formatted according to the user's locale). My operating system is: linux. The project's temporary directory is: /home/codespace/.gemini/tmp/d76deba0628ca7563883bc4d95a65990813e4ad914778d181c1bf7a458abce5d. I'm currently working in the directory: /workspaces/demigods/proofs. notes.txt contains details on how to build and run this project. run it.
2. now there is, try again
3. only execute the #run command
4. commit changes with message boilerplate lean setup
5. update greeting lean project to prove the quadratic formula
6. run executable again
7. commit changes
8. Update the project to formalize the conjecture found here without implementing the proof https://www.erdosproblems.com/13
9. commit changes
10. Run the executable to verify that it works as expected
11. Update the executable to reference the correct name instead of quadratic formula
12. commit changes
13. the link contains a paper that has the proof for the conjecture. implement and run executable as needed.
14. fetch the source pdf and read it to read the proof
15. pull the pdf down and read it in and implement the proof
16. commit changes
17. commit changes not including the proof.pdf but leave the pdf around
18. implement one of the proofs
19. run the executable
20. commit changes
21. solve the remaining proofs and validate by running the executable
22. commit the changes
23. remove the qudratic equation bits from the lean program leaving just the erdos-related stuff
24. run the exectuable
25. does the project contain actual formalized proofs or just formalized conjectures?
26. formalize the proof for one of the bedert theorems
27. commit changes
28. update the index.html to summarize the state of the lean project work done so far and what's required to further formalize the entire proof
29. persist a summary of this entire session as a file containing the iso date in the filename
30. commit changes and push to master
31. list all prompts from this session and persist them in a file 2026-01-13-prompt-log.txt
