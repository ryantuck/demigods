                The Navier-Stokes equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe the motion of viscous fluid substances.
                Named after French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier and Anglo-Irish physicist and mathematician George Gabriel Stokes,
                they are a cornerstone of fluid mechanics.

                The Millennium Prize Problems are seven problems in mathematics that were stated by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000.
                As of January 2026, six of the problems remain unsolved. A correct solution to any of the problems results in a US$1 million prize.

                The Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness problem is to prove or disprove the existence of smooth, globally-defined solutions
                to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. A positive answer would mean that the equations are well-behaved and can be
                used to predict the behavior of fluids in a wide range of situations. A negative answer would mean that the equations can
                break down, and new mathematical tools would be needed to understand the behavior of fluids in these situations.
