            <h2>Imagine a Water Recipe</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine you have a super special recipe. But instead of baking a cake, this recipe tells you <em>exactly</em> how water, air, honey, or any liquid or gas will move. This recipe is called the <strong>Navier-Stokes Equations</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Engineers use this recipe to design airplanes that fly smoothly through the air, doctors use it to understand how blood flows in your body, and we even use it to predict the weather. It's a very, very important recipe!

            <h2>The Million-Dollar Question</h2>
            <p>
                There's just one problem. We're not 100% sure the recipe works all the time. For simple, smooth-flowing water, it's perfect. But what about really crazy, splashy, turbulent water?
            </p>
            <p>
                The big question, worth <strong>$1,000,000</strong>, is this: Does the recipe ever just... break?
            </p>
            <p>
                When mathematicians say "break," they mean, do the equations predict something impossible? Like the water suddenly moving at an infinite speed at a tiny, tiny point. They call this a <strong>"singularity"</strong> or a <strong>"blow-up."</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                So, the problem is to prove one of two things:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>YES</strong>, the recipe always works! It will never tell you that water does impossible things. The flow will always be "smooth."</li>
                <li>...or...</li>
                <li><strong>NO</strong>, the recipe can break. And here is an example of exactly when and how it breaks.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What's a "Singularity"? (ELI5)</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine you're spinning a whirlpool in a bucket. It gets faster and faster in the middle. Now, what if you could spin it so fast that the very center point was spinning... infinitely fast?
            </p>
            <p>
                That's a singularity! It's a point where our math recipe gives us a nonsense answer like "infinity." If that can happen, it means our perfect recipe for fluid motion has a flaw, a situation it can't describe. The Millennium Problem asks if these "infinite whirlpools" can actually form according to the recipe, or if the recipe itself has hidden rules that always smooth things out before they get that crazy.
            </p>
             <div class="simulation-link">
                <p>
                    We can't create an infinite whirlpool, but we can see how complex flows form in a computer simulation! The one below is set up to make two jets of fluid collide, creating a turbulent mess that hints at the kind of chaos mathematicians are studying.

            <h2>How Are People Trying to Solve It?</h2>
            <p>
                This is a super hard problem that the smartest people in the world have been stuck on for a long, long time. They are trying a few things:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wrestling with the Math:</strong> Some mathematicians are trying to use pure, creative math to prove that a "singularity" is impossible. They are looking for some hidden elegance in the equations that guarantees the answer is always smooth and well-behaved.</li>
                <li><strong>Hunting for the Glitch:</strong> Others think a singularity <em>can</em> happen. They use powerful computers to simulate extreme fluid flows, hoping to find a specific starting setup that will cause the equations to "blow up." The colliding jets in our simulation are a very, very simplified version of this idea.</li>
                <li><strong>Changing the Rules:</strong> Some scientists study slightly different, simpler versions of the equations. The hope is that by solving a simpler problem, they might get a clue about how to solve the big, complicated one.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Why Is It So Hard?</h2>
            <p>
                The problem is that everything in the fluid affects everything else, all at the same time. The way a swirl moves over here can instantly change the pressure way over there, which then changes how the first swirl moves. This chaotic feedback loop is called <strong>non-linearity</strong>, and it's what makes turbulence one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in all of physics.

            <h2>Why Does It Matter?</h2>
            <p>
                If we can solve this problem, it would be about more than just a million dollars. It would give us a much deeper understanding of the universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the answer is "YES, the recipe always works," it would give us even more confidence in our computer simulations of everything from weather to airplane wings.
            </p>
             <p>
                If the answer is "NO, the recipe can break," it would be even more exciting! It would mean there is new physics and new math to be discovered that can describe what happens when things go completely wild.
