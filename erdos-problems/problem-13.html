            <h2>The Game Rules</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine you have a bag of numbered balls, from 1 to some number N (like 100). You want to pick as many balls as you can, but there's a tricky rule.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you pick any three balls, let's call them A, B, and C (where A is the smallest), the sum of the bigger two (B + C) cannot be divisible by the smallest one (A).
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if you pick 2, 4, and 6:
                <br>
                Smallest is 2. The others are 4 and 6.
                <br>
                Sum is 4 + 6 = 10.
                <br>
                Does 2 divide 10? Yes! (10 / 2 = 5).
                <br>
                So you <strong>cannot</strong> have 2, 4, and 6 in your set together.
            </p>

            <h2>The Question</h2>
            <p>
                Paul Erdős, a famous mathematician who loved asking these kinds of questions, asked: "What is the maximum number of balls you can pick without breaking this rule?"
            </p>
            <p>
                It turns out the answer is roughly <strong>one-third</strong> of the total balls. So if you have 100 balls, you can pick about 33 of them safely.

            <h2>The Formal Proof</h2>
            <p>
                We have formalized the statement of this problem in the Lean programming language. This allows computers to verify the math exactly.

Let A ⊆ {1, ..., N} be such that there are no a, b, c ∈ A 
such that a ∣ (b + c) and a < min b c. 
Then |A| ≤ N / 3 + O(1).
